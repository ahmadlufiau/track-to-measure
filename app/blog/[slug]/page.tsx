      <h2>Introduction to Google Tag Manager</h2>
      <p>Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a free tag management system that allows you to manage and deploy marketing tags (snippets of code or tracking pixels) on your website without having to modify the code.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 1: Create a Google Tag Manager Account</h2>
      <p>Go to <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/" class="text-emerald-600 hover:underline">tagmanager.google.com</a> and sign in with your Google account. Click on "Create Account" and fill in your account name, country, and container name (usually your website name).</p>
      
      <h2>Step 2: Install the GTM Code</h2>
      <p>After creating your account, GTM will provide you with two code snippets:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
        <li>The first snippet goes in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your website</li>
        <li>The second snippet goes immediately after the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Step 3: Verify Installation</h2>
      <p>Use the "Preview" mode in GTM to verify that your container is working correctly. You can also use our Tag Checker tool to confirm the installation.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 4: Add Tags, Triggers, and Variables</h2>
      <p>Now you can start adding marketing tags to your GTM container. Common tags include Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and conversion tracking pixels.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 5: Publish Your Container</h2>
      <p>Once you've added and tested your tags, click the "Submit" button to publish your container. This will make your tags live on your website.</p>

      <h2>Introduction to Google Analytics 4</h2>
      <p>Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest version of Google Analytics. It uses a different data model than Universal Analytics and provides more comprehensive tracking across websites and apps.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 1: Create a GA4 Property</h2>

      <h2>Step 3: Install the GA4 Tracking Code</h2>
      <p>There are two main ways to install GA4:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
        <li>Directly on your website by adding the gtag.js code to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your website</li>
        <li>Through Google Tag Manager (recommended)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Step 4: Set Up Enhanced Measurement</h2>
      <p>GA4 includes enhanced measurement features that automatically track page views, scrolls, outbound clicks, site search, video engagement, and file downloads. You can enable or disable these features in the GA4 admin section.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 5: Verify Installation</h2>
      <p>Use the "DebugView" in GA4 to verify that your tracking is working correctly. You can also use our Tag Checker tool to confirm the installation.</p>
